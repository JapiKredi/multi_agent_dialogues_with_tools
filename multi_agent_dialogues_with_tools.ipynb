Watch this space - results are due to be published at the Sustainable Development Impact Meetings in September. Lawrence et al.

This suggests a significant potential for job displacement. However, it's important to note that AI and automation may not necessarily eliminate jobs outright, but rather change the nature of work in certain sectors. For instance, AI is expected to enhance the work of STEM, creative, and business and legal professionals rather than eliminating a significant number of jobs outright. On the other hand, office support, customer service, and food service employment could continue to decline due to automation. This underscores the need for proactive strategies to support workers in sectors most vulnerable to automation, such as retraining programs and policies that promote job creation in sectors less likely to be automated. It's also worth noting that some argue AI automation could have large positive spillover effects, counteracting the negative direct effects of substitution in the labour market through a process of 'creative destruction'.
